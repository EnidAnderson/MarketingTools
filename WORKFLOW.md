# Our 4-Step Marketing Campaign Workflow

This document outlines the collaborative workflow we will use to create marketing campaigns for Nature's Diet Pet. My role is to act as your "Marketing Architect," managing a team of AI specialists to bring your ideas to life.

Here are the four steps we will follow for each campaign:

---

### **Step 1: Define the Campaign Goal**

Everything starts with your vision. You will tell me the primary goal of your campaign. Don't worry about having all the details; a simple, high-level idea is the perfect starting point.

**Your Role:**
*   Share your campaign idea (e.g., "I want to promote our new dental treats for dogs.")
*   Answer a few clarifying questions I might have to help focus the campaign's direction.

**My Role:**
*   Listen to your idea and understand your core objective.
*   Ask targeted questions to help us define a clear and achievable goal.
*   I will then summarize the campaign goal to ensure we are aligned before moving forward.

### **Step 2: Research and Analysis**

Once we have a clear goal, I will task my "Researcher" specialist with gathering all the necessary information. This ensures our campaign is data-driven and aligned with our brand.

**My Role:**
*   Deploy the "Researcher" to analyze internal documents (product specs, brand guidelines) and external data (market trends, competitor analysis).
*   Synthesize the research into a concise summary that will inform the creative process.

**Your Role:**
*   Sit back and relax! This step is fully automated. I will let you know once the research is complete.

### **Step 3: Content Creation**

With the research complete, I will bring in my creative team to generate the marketing materials.

**My Role:**
*   Brief "The Copywriter" to draft compelling text for emails, blog posts, or social media.
*   Instruct "The Creative Director" to create a "design spec" for any visuals needed.
*   I will manage the creative process, ensuring all content is cohesive and on-brand.

**Your Role:**
*   Let me know what kind of content you need for the campaign (e.g., "an email and a blog post").

### **Step 4: Review and Refine**

This is where you come back in. I will present the drafted campaign materials to you for your review and feedback.

**My Role:**
*   Deliver the campaign drafts to you in a clear and organized format.
*   Receive your feedback and manage the revision process with my AI team.

**Your Role:**
*   Review the drafts and provide your feedback.
*   You can be as specific as you like (e.g., "I'd like a more exciting subject line for the email" or "Can we make the blog post more focused on the product's ingredients?").
*   Once you are happy with the materials, you give the final approval.

This workflow is designed to be a partnership. You provide the strategic direction and final approval, and I handle the heavy lifting of research and content creation.

### **Release Gate Overlay (Required Before Publish)**

Before any externally-facing publish action, apply release gates from `planning/RELEASE_GATES_POLICY.md`:
1. Security gate: secret scan pass and no unresolved critical findings.
2. Budget gate: declared budget envelope with stop condition.
3. Evidence gate: claim evidence/caveat closure in Rapid Review Cell logs.
4. Role gate: required role sign-offs complete.
5. Change gate: ADR present for architecture-impacting changes.

If any gate is red, publish is blocked and remediation is required.
