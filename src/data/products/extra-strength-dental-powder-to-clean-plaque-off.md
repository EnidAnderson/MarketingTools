Product Name: Extra Strength Dental Powder to Clean Plaque Off

### Detailed Description
This professional-grade pet dental powder simplifies oral care by working systemically to prevent plaque and remove tartar, which can cause bad breath and stained teeth. It uses a blend of natural ingredients to disrupt plaque biofilms, making it easier for the mouth's natural processes to clear away bacteria and food particles.
