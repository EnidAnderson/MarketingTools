A professional-grade pet dental powder designed to simplify oral care. It works systemically to prevent plaque and remove tartar while freshening breath and improving gum health. The powder utilizes a natural enzyme found in Icelandic kelp, which helps break down the sticky plaque biofilms on teeth, making it easier for them to be cleared away.
