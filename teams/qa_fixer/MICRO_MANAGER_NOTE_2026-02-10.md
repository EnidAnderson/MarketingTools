# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## Current issue
No QA fix log output observed this cycle.

## Improvement requests
1. Do not edit until Grey publishes prioritized directive.
2. Every edit must reference `decision_id` or `change_request_id`.
3. Record verification evidence and residual risk in `pipeline/07_qa_fix_log.md`.

## Next-cycle requirement
When activated, implement only the top-priority Grey bundle and log full provenance.
