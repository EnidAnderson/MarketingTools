# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## What you did well
1. Strong strategic clarity and audience framing.
2. Produced actionable downstream requests.

## Improvement requests
1. Stop issuing duplicate semantics with new IDs unless explicitly superseding old IDs in the same output entry.
2. Add `Explicit Non-Goals` section every time to match required output contract.
3. Keep request volume tighter per cycle (max 3 priority requests) to avoid downstream queue saturation.

## Next-cycle requirement
Submit one consolidated Blue memo with only net-new strategy deltas and explicit supersede mapping.
