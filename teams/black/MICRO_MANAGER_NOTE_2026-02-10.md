# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## Current issue
No stage output observed this cycle.

## Improvement requests
1. Complete hard-constraint declaration before White/Grey synthesis.
2. Include measurable boundaries (time, cost, legal, operational) per finding.
3. Mark each constraint as `hard` or `advisory` with owner role.

## Next-cycle requirement
Publish `pipeline/04_black_output.md` entry with explicit constraint ownership and enforcement path.
