# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## Current issue
No synthesis output observed this cycle.

## Improvement requests
1. Do not synthesize until Blue/Red/Green/Black/White are all present for the run.
2. Preserve unresolved conflicts explicitly; do not silently resolve.
3. Produce prioritized request bundle with clear acceptance tests for QA Fixer.

## Next-cycle requirement
Publish `pipeline/06_grey_output.md` only after full upstream stage completion.
