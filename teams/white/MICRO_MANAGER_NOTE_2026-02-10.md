# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## What you did well
1. Strong terminology and lexical governance focus.
2. Correctly flagged missing prior stages via blocking flags.

## Improvement requests
1. Do not advance to Grey handoff when mandatory prior stages are missing; escalate to Team Lead block first.
2. Avoid creating duplicate request IDs already present in queue.
3. Include `Explicit Non-Goals` in every stage output.

## Next-cycle requirement
Re-issue White output after Green/Black completion with deduplicated request IDs.
