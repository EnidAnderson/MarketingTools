# Micro-Manager Note (2026-02-10)

## What you did well
1. Good adversarial framing and testable risk signals.

## Improvement requests
1. Do not reuse request IDs already active from other teams.
2. Tag each risk with one explicit detection trigger and one owner role.
3. Keep requests focused on risk articulation only; avoid drifting into solution design.

## Next-cycle requirement
Deliver a compact risk table with unique request IDs and no duplicate scope.
